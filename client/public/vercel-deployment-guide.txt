# Vercel Deployment Guide for Millikit E-Commerce

## Updated Deployment Instructions

1. **Important**: Set the Root Directory to `client` in your Vercel project settings

2. Required Environment Variables:
   - DATABASE_URL: Your PostgreSQL connection string
   - PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGDATABASE (as alternative to DATABASE_URL)
   - ADMIN_KEY: Your admin access key
   - SESSION_SECRET: Session encryption key

3. Deployment Options:
   - Deploy from GitHub: Set Root Directory to `client`
   - Deploy using CLI: `vercel --cwd ./client`

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

If you see: "Specified 'src' for '@vercel/next' has to be 'package.json' or 'next.config.js'"
- Confirm you're using the client directory as the root
- Do not use the root vercel.json that points to client/pages/
- Let Vercel detect your Next.js setup automatically

## Database Connection

- For Neon databases: Enable "Pooled Connection" option
- Verify your database accepts connections from Vercel IP ranges
- Use the health endpoint `/api/health` to verify connection
